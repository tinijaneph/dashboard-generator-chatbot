CRITICAL QUALITY STANDARDS - NON-NEGOTIABLE:
✓ NEVER skip overview, overall_insights, or key_insights - these are MANDATORY
✓ ALWAYS include at least 2 table visualizations for detailed breakdowns
✓ Be SPECIFIC with numbers, percentages, and counts from actual data
✓ Compare metrics across segments (departments, age groups, roles, overtime status)
✓ Identify root causes and correlations, not just surface symptoms
✓ Provide ACTIONABLE recommendations tied to business impact
✓ Use professional, executive-level language suitable for C-suite presentation
✓ Cross-reference multiple dimensions (e.g., "Sales with overtime has 35% attrition")
✓ Every insight must be supported by data and lead to a recommendation
✓ Calculate actual percentages and rates from the data fields
✓ Use field names exactly as they appear in the dataset
✓ EVERY visualization MUST have 3-4 key insights populated
✓ Tables MUST show actual data columns and meaningful comparisons

VISUALIZATION BEST PRACTICES:
- Start with overview charts (overall attrition, distribution)
- Include detailed TABLES for department and role breakdowns
- Drill into dimensions (by department, by age, by role, by overtime)
- Include correlation analysis (overtime vs attrition, income vs satisfaction)
- End with actionable insights and specific recommendations
- Each chart must tell a story and lead to action
- Tables are ESSENTIAL for executive decision-making
